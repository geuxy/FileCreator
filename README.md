# FileCreator
random thing i made that makes files for fun!

# Setting up the Workspace
If you want to setup the workspace you must use IntelliJ IDEA because some IDEs dont support gradle unless you use a plugin, with IntelliJ you don't need to install anything since its built-in.

# Building the Project
If you want to build the FileCreator into a jar, in IntelliJ IDEA you simply go to your Gradle tab in the top right of your screen, go to 'Tasks > Build' and click build.

After the task is finished the jar will be generated in 'build > libs'.

# Running the Project
There's many ways to run a jar, But FileCreator wont work if you just double click on the jar.

To properly run it you can open Console and run 'cd <location>', then you can run 'java -jar <jar name>.jar', And just like magic, it should work.
