# FileCreator
random thing i made that makes files for fun and understanding File and Scanner a bit better!

# Setting up the Workspace
If you want to setup the workspace you must use IntelliJ IDEA because some IDEs dont support gradle unless you use a plugin, with IntelliJ you don't need to install anything since its built-in.

# Building the Project
If you want to build the FileCreator into a jar, in IntelliJ IDEA you simply go to your Gradle tab in the top right of your screen, go to 'Tasks > Build' and click build.

After the task is finished the jar will be generated in 'build > libs'.

# Running the Project
There's many ways to run a jar, But FileCreator wont work if you just double click on the jar.

FileCreator was designed to only run on Command Prompt/Console.

To launch FileCreator we need to open Command Prompt, When its open run 'cd (directory that the jar is in)' so command prompt can find the jar.
Then run 'java -jar (jar name).jar' and it should work.
